For an undo/redo operation can be implemented using two stacks, one for undo 
operations and one for redo operations. The idea is to push all the performed 
actions onto the undo stack. When an undo operation is performed, the current 
state of the system is popped from the undo stack and pushed onto the redo 
stack. When a redo operation is performed, the previous state is popped from 
the redo stack and pushed back onto the undo stack. Here is a high-level outline 
of the steps involved:
 Initialize two stacks, one for undo operations and one for redo operations.
 Whenever an action is performed, push it onto the undo stack.

 When an undo operation is performed, pop the top element from the 
undo stack and push it onto the redo stack.
 When a redo operation is performed, pop the top element from the redo 
stack and push it back onto the undo stack.
 Repeat steps 3 and 4 as necessary to perform undo and redo operations.
Spooling is a process used by printers to manage print jobs, and the 
methodology of spooling can vary depending on the type of printer and 
operating system being used. Here is a general overview of the spooling process:
 Job submission: The user submits a print job to the printer.
 Job processing: The operating system converts the print job into a format 
that the printer can understand and temporarily stores the job in a buffer 
or spooling area.
 Job prioritization: The operating system decides the order in which the 
jobs will be processed based on the priority level set by the user.
 Job printing: The printer retrieves the job from the spooling area, 
processes the job, and begins printing it on the page.
 Job completion: Once the job has been printed, it is removed from the 
spooling area and the printer is ready to process the next job.
The spooling process allows multiple print jobs to be processed in parallel, which 
can improve the overall efficiency of the printing system. Additionally, spooling 
allows print jobs to be processed in the background, freeing up the user's 
computer for other tasks while the print job is being processed.

A linked list is a linear data structure that stores elements in sequences, where 
each element is called a node. In a linked list, each node contains a value and a 
reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
 To store elements in a linked list, you can follow these steps:
 Create a node class: This class will define the structure of each node in the 
linked list. It should contain two properties, one for the value and one for 
the reference to the next node.
 Create the linked list class: This class will define the linked list structure. It 
should have a head property that keeps track of the first node in the list.
 Add elements to the linked list: To add elements to the linked list, you can 
create a new node for each element and update the next_node reference 
of the previous node to point to the new node.
By following these steps, you can store elements in a linked list in a sequence, 
where each node in the list points to the next node, forming a chain-like 
structure
